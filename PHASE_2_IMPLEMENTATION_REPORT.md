## Technical Architecture

### Component Hierarchy

```
Owner Dashboard
├── ApplicationCard (mode="owner")
│   ├── onViewDetails → handleViewApplication()
│   └── onStatusChange → handleViewApplication()
└── ApplicationDetailDialog (mode="owner")
    ├── View full application details
    ├── Edit internal notes
    ├── Update status buttons
    └── onStatusUpdated → handleApplicationUpdated()

Seeker Dashboard
├── ApplicationCard (mode="seeker")
│   └── onViewDetails → opens dialog
└── ApplicationDetailDialog (mode="seeker")
    └── View application details (read-only)
```

### Data Flow

**Owner Status Update Flow:**
```
1. User clicks status button on ApplicationCard
   ↓
2. handleViewApplication() sets selectedApplication
   ↓
3. Dialog opens with application details
   ↓
4. User adds notes and clicks status button
   ↓
5. ApplicationDetailDialog calls PATCH /api/applications/[id]
   ↓
6. API validates, updates Firestore, returns updated application
   ↓
7. onStatusUpdated callback updates local state
   ↓
8. fetchDashboardData() refreshes full dashboard
   ↓
9. Dialog closes, success notification shown
```

**Seeker View Flow:**
```
1. User clicks "View full details" on ApplicationCard
   ↓
2. setState updates selectedApplication
   ↓
3. Dialog opens with application details
   ↓
4. User views status, timeline, employer feedback
   ↓
5. User closes dialog
```

   - **Impact:** Seekers cannot submit applications via UI yet
   - **Workaround:** Applications can be created via API directly
   - **Priority:** High for full Phase 2 completion

2. **No Resume Upload**
   - **Status:** resumeUrl field exists but no upload UI
   - **Impact:** Resumes must be hosted externally
   - **Priority:** Medium

3. **No Application Search/Filter**
   - **Status:** Basic listing only
   - **Impact:** Large application volumes may be difficult to manage
   - **Priority:** Low for MVP

4. **No Email Notifications**
   - **Status:** Not implemented
   - **Impact:** Users must check dashboard for updates
   - **Priority:** Medium

---

## Future Enhancements

### Recommended Next Steps

**High Priority:**
1. ✅ Create job application submission form for seekers
2. ✅ Add application search and filtering for owners
3. ✅ Implement pagination for large application lists

**Medium Priority:**
4. ✅ Resume file upload (Cloud Storage integration)
5. ✅ Email notifications on status changes
6. ✅ Application comments/messaging system
7. ✅ Bulk actions (accept/reject multiple applications)

**Low Priority:**
8. ✅ Application analytics dashboard
9. ✅ Export applications to CSV
10. ✅ Application templates
11. ✅ Saved application responses

---

## Security Considerations

### Authentication

- ✅ All endpoints require valid Firebase Auth token
- ✅ Owner role verification for status updates
- ✅ Permission checks ensure owners only manage their applications
- ✅ Seekers can only view their own applications

### Data Validation

- ✅ Zod schema validation on API routes
- ✅ Character limits enforced (notes: 2000 chars)
- ✅ Status enum validation
- ✅ Input sanitization

### API Security

- ✅ PATCH endpoint restricted to owners only
- ✅ Application ownership verified before updates
- ✅ No sensitive data exposed in public endpoints

## Team Notes

### For Future Developers

**Component Usage Examples:**

**Owner Dashboard Integration:**
```typescript
import { ApplicationDetailDialog } from '@/components/application-detail-dialog'

const [selectedApp, setSelectedApp] = useState<Application | null>(null)
const [dialogOpen, setDialogOpen] = useState(false)

<ApplicationDetailDialog
  application={selectedApp}
  mode="owner"
  open={dialogOpen}
  onOpenChange={setDialogOpen}
  onStatusUpdated={(app) => {
    // Handle updated application
    refreshData()
  }}
/>
```

**Seeker Dashboard Integration:**
```typescript
<ApplicationDetailDialog
  application={selectedApp}
  mode="seeker"
  open={dialogOpen}
  onOpenChange={setDialogOpen}
  // No onStatusUpdated needed for seekers
/>
```

### Authentication Pattern

**Always use this pattern:**
```typescript
import { auth } from '@/lib/firebase/client'

const currentUser = auth.currentUser
if (!currentUser) {
  toast.error('Authentication required')
  return
}
const token = await currentUser.getIdToken()
```

**Never use:**
```typescript
// ❌ WRONG - user from AuthContext doesn't have getIdToken()
const token = await user.getIdToken()
```
