## 🎯 Current Production Baseline

- `main` → `91263b1` (`chore: Add Google Search Console verification file (#67)`)
- Production smoke tests introduced in PR **#64** (`c4e1934`) and now run on every push to `main`
- Firestore composite index for `jobs.status` queries merged via PR **#62**
- Repository housekeeping complete: stale PRs closed (#44, #45, #61) and branches pruned
- Google Search Console verification asset deployed and reachable at `/googlee573592846ba27d6.html`

## 🔐 Quality & Safety Nets

| Guardrail | Description | Location |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| Branch naming validation | Requires `type/ID-slug` (`feat|fix|perf|sec|docs|test|refactor|ci|build`) | `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (`validate-branch`) |
| Commit message linting | Enforces Conventional Commits on PRs | `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (`validate-commits`) |
| Build + Budget checks | Lint, type-check, build, first-load JS budget, artifact upload | `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (`build`) |
| Accessibility testing | Playwright + axe-core against `/`, `/dashboard`, `/subscribe` | `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (`accessibility`) |
| Production smoke tests | Live-site verification of employer, seeker, and jobs flows | `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (`production-smoke-tests`) |

All checks are required on `main` via branch protection rules, ensuring every merge keeps the site healthy.

## 🔄 Optional Next Actions

1. **Activate Google Search Console** – Add `shopmatch-pro.vercel.app` property and confirm HTML verification.
2. **Review Dependabot updates** – Closed PRs (#44, #45) will re-open as new branches following naming rules.
3. **Monitor smoke tests** – Check GitHub Actions “Production Smoke Tests” job after each push to `main`.
4. **Schedule observability checks** – Use `docs/MONITORING_CHECKLIST.md` for daily/weekly post-launch cadence.

The codebase is synchronized, guardrails are active, and production monitoring is online — you're clear to start new features immediately.
