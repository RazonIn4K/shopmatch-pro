## üÜò Troubleshooting

### If Smoke Tests Fail on CI

**Check:**
1. Production health: https://shopmatch-pro.vercel.app/api/health
2. Demo credentials in Firebase Console
3. Vercel deployment status
4. Recent code changes that might affect auth

**Debug locally:**
```bash
BASE_URL=https://shopmatch-pro.vercel.app npx playwright test verify-demo-login.spec.ts --headed --debug
```

### If Documentation Commit Fails

**Check:**
```bash
git status
git diff --cached
```

**Fix:**
```bash
git reset HEAD <file>
# Review file
git add <file>
git commit --amend
```
