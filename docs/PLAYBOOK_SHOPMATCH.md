# Playbook — Task SOP (SHOOT → SKIN)

Follow for each card:
1) Kickoff with Owner Persona → pick UX pattern
2) Micro CPM note (risks, layers, baseline)
3) Implement + tests
4) Inject one Wrench → resolve via runbooks
5) Gate: CI green + budgets + docs updated
6) SKIN: Synthesis note (what shipped, wrench, fix, insight)
