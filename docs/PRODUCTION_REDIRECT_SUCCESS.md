## üîç **Root Cause Analysis**

### **The Problem**

After completing Stripe checkout, users were being redirected to:
```
http://localhost:3000/dashboard
```

Instead of the production URL:
```
https://shopmatch-pro.vercel.app/dashboard
```

### **Why This Happened**

The issue was caused by **`NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` not being set in Vercel production environment.**

1. **Build-Time vs Runtime**: `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` environment variables are embedded into the JavaScript bundle **at build time**, not runtime
2. **Missing Variable**: The Vercel production environment didn't have `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` set
3. **Fallback Failed**: The fallback logic in `src/lib/env.ts` wasn't working as expected due to:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_VERCEL_URL` being undefined
   - `VERCEL_URL` not being accessible in the context
   - Falling back to the hardcoded default: `http://localhost:3000`

### **Code Location**

**File:** `src/lib/env.ts`
```typescript
export function getAppBaseUrl(): string {
  const candidates = [
    process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL,          // ‚ùå Was undefined in production
    process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_VERCEL_URL,       // ‚ùå Also undefined
    process.env.VERCEL_URL,                   // ‚ùå Not accessible
    process.env.VERCEL_PROJECT_PRODUCTION_URL // ‚ùå Not accessible
  ]

  for (const candidate of candidates) {
    const normalised = normaliseUrl(candidate)
    if (normalised) {
      return normalised
    }
  }

  return DEFAULT_APP_URL  // ‚ùå Returned 'http://localhost:3000'
}
```

**Used in:** `src/app/api/stripe/checkout/route.ts`
```typescript
const baseUrl = getAppBaseUrl()

const session = await stripe.checkout.sessions.create({
  success_url: `${baseUrl}/dashboard?success=true&session_id={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}`,
  cancel_url: `${baseUrl}/subscribe?canceled=true`,
  // ...
})
```

## ‚úÖ **The Fix**

### **Step 1: Set Production Environment Variable**

```bash
echo "https://shopmatch-pro.vercel.app" | vercel env add NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL production
```

**Result:**
```
‚úÖ Added Environment Variable NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL to Project shopmatch-pro
```

### **Step 2: Trigger Fresh Deployment**

Created and merged **PR #37**:
- **Title:** "fix: Correct NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL for production redirects"
- **Branch:** `fix/production-redirect-issue` ‚Üí `main`
- **Merge Method:** Squash and merge

This triggered an automatic Vercel deployment with the new environment variable baked into the build.

### **Step 3: Verify the Fix**

**Before:**
```json
{
  "NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL": "http://localhost:3000\n",
  "computedBaseUrl": "http://localhost:3000"
}
```

**After:**
```json
{
  "NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL": "https://shopmatch-pro.vercel.app\n",
  "computedBaseUrl": "https://shopmatch-pro.vercel.app"
}
```

## üß™ **Verification Testing**

### **Test Account Created**
- **Email:** `playwright.final.test@example.com`
- **Password:** `TestPassword123!`
- **Role:** Employer
- **Subscription:** ‚úÖ Pro (Active)

### **Stripe Checkout Test**
- **Test Card:** `4242 4242 4242 4242`
- **Expiry:** `12/34`
- **CVC:** `123`
- **Address:** `123 Main St, New York, NY 10001`
- **Phone:** `(201) 555-1234`
- **Payment Status:** ‚úÖ Successful

### **URL Verification**

**Cancel URL (on Stripe checkout page):**
```
‚úÖ https://shopmatch-pro.vercel.app/subscribe?canceled=true
```

**Success Redirect (after payment):**
```
‚úÖ https://shopmatch-pro.vercel.app/dashboard/owner
```

**Job Creation:**
```
‚úÖ https://shopmatch-pro.vercel.app/jobs/new
```

## üéØ **Success Criteria - ALL MET**

- ‚úÖ Checkout redirects to production URL (not localhost)
- ‚úÖ Can create jobs after subscription (no 403 error)
- ‚úÖ Webhooks process successfully (subscription activated)
- ‚úÖ Custom claims updated (user has employer permissions)
- ‚úÖ No localhost URLs anywhere in production flow

---

## üìù **Key Learnings**

1. **`NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variables are build-time, not runtime**
   - Removing a variable requires a fresh build
   - `--force` flag clears build cache
   - Setting the variable to the correct value is more reliable than relying on fallbacks

2. **Vercel Environment Variables**
   - Production variables must be explicitly set
   - Changes require redeployment to take effect
   - Use `vercel env ls production` to verify

3. **Testing Strategy**
   - Always test the complete checkout flow
   - Verify both cancel AND success URLs
   - Confirm post-checkout functionality (job creation)
   - Use automated testing (Playwright) for consistency
