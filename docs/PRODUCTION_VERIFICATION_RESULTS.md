## Known Issues

### Non-Critical Issues

   - Plan: Address in separate accessibility PR

2. **FOSSA Dependency Quality** (8 issues):
   - Minor dependency version recommendations
   - No security vulnerabilities
   - Impact: Low (non-blocking for production)
   - Plan: Review and update dependencies quarterly

### Resolved Issues

1. **Missing NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY** ✅
   - Detected: Oct 20, 2025
   - Fixed: Added to Vercel production environment
   - Status: Resolved

2. **Branch Protection PR Requirement** ✅
   - Issue: Direct push to main blocked
   - Solution: All changes via PRs (#53, #54)

2. **Sentry Dashboard Setup** (30 min) - Required for production monitoring

Both steps are fully documented in [PRODUCTION_MONITORING_PAYMENTS_SETUP.md](./PRODUCTION_MONITORING_PAYMENTS_SETUP.md) and can be completed in **50 minutes total**.

All critical infrastructure is operational:
- ✅ Build optimized and deployed
- ✅ Firestore security and performance ready
- ✅ Legal compliance met
- ✅ Test mode payments working end-to-end
- ✅ Error tracking installed
- ✅ Security headers configured

**Recommended Path Forward**:
1. Execute Stripe webhook setup (20 min)
