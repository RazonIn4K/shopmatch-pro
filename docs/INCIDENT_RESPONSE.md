# Incident Response (Mini)

## Severity
- P1: Payments/auth data at risk or major outage
- P2: Core feature broken (post job, apply)
- P3: Minor bug

## On-Call Flow (Solo Simulation)
1. Create incident note in Execution Journal
2. Reproduce & capture evidence (logs, screenshots)
3. Mitigate (feature flag / rollback if needed)
4. Root cause & fix
5. Post-mortem in journal with action items
