# ShopMatch Pro – Portfolio Blurb

ShopMatch Pro is a full-stack SaaS demo that proves I can architect production-grade analytics experiences on top of a modern Next.js/TypeScript stack. The project showcases a polished dashboard, configurable KPI storytelling, and a ready-to-demo analytics workflow tailored for founders, product teams, and agencies. Every chart, funnel, and insight is built to be swapped onto real data sources in minutes, so clients can immediately visualize the value for their own products.

**Key Outcomes**
- Delivered a reusable dashboard layout + analytics view with configurable datasets (job boards, course marketplaces, etc.).
- Demonstrated end-to-end thinking: authentication, routing, responsive UI, seeded KPIs, and narrative insights meant for executive walk-throughs.
- Documented demo scripts, Loom narration, and talk tracks so agencies/founders can quickly evaluate how the work maps to their SaaS.
