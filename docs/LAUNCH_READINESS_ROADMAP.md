## üöß **Blockers & Dependencies**

### **Phase 1 ‚Üí Phase 2**
- ‚úÖ No dependencies, can start immediately

- ‚úÖ No hard dependencies
- üìù Recommended: Have monitoring first to catch payment issues

### **Phase 4 ‚Üí Phase 5**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Blocker:** Must have analytics before user acquisition
- Reason: Need to measure conversion, behavior, feedback

### **Overall**
- üî¥ **Critical Path:** Monitoring ‚Üí Legal ‚Üí Live Mode ‚Üí Analytics ‚Üí Users
- Cannot skip or reorder without accepting significant risk

## üö® **Risk Management**

### **High Risk Items**

**1. Monitoring Failure**
- **Risk:** Issues go undetected, users churn
- **Mitigation:** Test all alerts before user acquisition
- **Contingency:** Manual checks every 4 hours

**2. Payment Processing Issues**
- **Risk:** Failed subscriptions, lost revenue
- **Mitigation:** Extensive testing in live mode
- **Contingency:** Support email for payment help

**3. Poor User Experience**
- **Risk:** Beta users don't see value
- **Mitigation:** Clear onboarding, responsive support
- **Contingency:** Direct calls with early users

**4. Legal Issues**
- **Risk:** Compliance problems, liability
- **Mitigation:** Standard legal templates, lawyer review (optional)
- **Contingency:** Take site down if serious issue found

### **Medium Risk Items**

**5. Slow User Adoption**
- **Risk:** No one signs up
- **Mitigation:** Personal invitations, clear value prop
- **Contingency:** Iterate on messaging, offer incentives

**6. Technical Debt**
- **Risk:** Quick fixes create problems
- **Mitigation:** Code reviews, testing
- **Contingency:** Allocate time for refactoring

## üéì **Lessons from Analysis**

### **Why This Order Matters**

**1. Monitoring First**
- Can't safely operate without knowing what's broken
- Every other phase depends on reliable monitoring
- 2-3 days now saves months of problems later

**2. Legal Before Live Mode**
- Stripe requires Terms of Service
- Protects business from liability
- Professional appearance to users

**3. Live Mode Before Users**
- Test mode doesn't validate payment flow
- Need real payment processing proven
- Can't generate revenue in test mode

**4. Analytics Before Scaling**
- Can't improve what you don't measure
- Need baseline metrics
- Must track conversion funnel

**5. Beta Before Public**
- Find issues with small group first
- Iterate based on real feedback
- Build confidence before scale

### **What NOT To Do**

‚ùå Skip monitoring and go straight to users  
‚ùå Launch in test mode indefinitely  
‚ùå Invite users before analytics is ready  
‚ùå Public launch without beta testing  
‚ùå Build features before validating current ones
