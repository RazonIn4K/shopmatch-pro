## Production Deployment Verification

### Current Production State

**Production URL**: https://shopmatch.highencodelearning.com

**Environment Variables** (Verified in Vercel Production):
- ✅ `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN` (configured 6 days ago)
- ✅ `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` (configured 8 days ago)
- ✅ `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` (configured 8 days ago)
- ✅ Firebase client config (NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_*)
- ✅ Firebase Admin SDK credentials
- ✅ Stripe API keys (production + test modes)

**Recent Deployments**: Active and stable
- Multiple production deployments visible
- Preview deployments for PRs working
- No deployment failures in recent history

### Monitoring & Observability

**Sentry Configuration** (next.config.ts):
```typescript
{
  org: "davidortizhighencodelearningco",
  project: "javascript-nextjs",
  widenClientFileUpload: true,
  reactComponentAnnotation: { enabled: true },
  tunnelRoute: "/monitoring",
  automaticVercelMonitors: true
}
```

**Key Features**:
- Source maps uploaded automatically ✅
- React component names in breadcrumbs ✅
- Ad-blocker bypass via tunnel route ✅
- Automatic Vercel Cron monitoring ✅
- Session replay configured (10% sample rate) ✅

### SEO & Metadata

**Meta Tags** (src/app/layout.tsx):
- ✅ Title: "ShopMatch Pro - Portfolio Demo Project"
- ✅ Description: Portfolio-focused description with tech stack mention
- ✅ OpenGraph tags (social sharing)
- ✅ Twitter Card tags
- ✅ Canonical URLs
- ✅ Robots meta (configured for demo: noindex, nofollow)
- ✅ Keywords: portfolio, demo, nextjs, typescript, firebase, stripe

**Note**: Robots meta is intentionally set to `noindex, nofollow` since this is a portfolio/demo project. For production use, update to:
```typescript
robots: {
  index: true,
  follow: true,
}
```

## Risk Assessment

### Current Risks: MINIMAL

| Risk Category | Level | Mitigation |
|---------------|-------|------------|
| **Security Vulnerabilities** | 🟢 Low | Automated scanning (CodeQL, Snyk), regular updates via Dependabot |
| **Production Outages** | 🟢 Low | Vercel SLA 99.99%, Firebase SLA 99.95%, Stripe SLA 99.99% |
| **Data Loss** | 🟢 Low | Firestore automatic backups, export scripts available |
| **Payment Failures** | 🟢 Low | Stripe webhook retry logic, idempotency keys, status tracking |
| **Unauthorized Access** | 🟢 Low | Firestore security rules, custom claims, role-based access |
| **Bundle Bloat** | 🟢 Low | CI enforcement of 300 KB budget, automatic blocking |
| **Accessibility Issues** | 🟢 Low | Automated axe-core testing, shadcn/ui accessible components |

### Known Limitations

1. **Demo/Portfolio Mode**: Robots meta set to `noindex` (intentional for demo project)
2. **Snyk Code Test Quota**: Exceeded on some PRs (expected with free plan)
3. **FOSSA False Positives**: License and dependency quality findings documented; dashboard policy/auto-ignore mediation still required
