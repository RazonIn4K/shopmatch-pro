## ✅ Production Smoke Test Automation

- PR **#64** (`c4e1934`) added `production-smoke-tests` job to `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- Job runs automatically on every push to `main` (guard clause `github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'`)
- Playwright suite executed: `e2e/verify-demo-login.spec.ts`
- Latest production run (commit `c4e1934` → main) completed **3 tests in 5.2 s**
  - Employer demo login → `/dashboard`
  - Seeker demo login → `/dashboard`
  - `/jobs` page content integrity
- Job uploads artifacts on failure for rapid triage; continues to provide continuous monitoring

**Evidence:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml:280-312`, `e2e/verify-demo-login.spec.ts`

## ✅ Google Search Console Integration

- PR **#67** (`91263b1`) merged via squash; branch `ci/MISC-001-google-verification`
- Verification asset deployed at `public/googlee573592846ba27d6.html`
- File contents match Google's HTML verification format:

```text
google-site-verification: googlee573592846ba27d6.html
```

- Live production URL: `https://shopmatch-pro.vercel.app/googlee573592846ba27d6.html`

---

## ✅ Repository Hygiene

- Closed outdated PRs (#44, #45, #61) and merged PRs #62, #64, #67
- Remote references pruned (`git fetch --prune`); local stale branches archived
- `git branch -r` (post-cleanup):

```bash
origin/HEAD -> origin/main
origin/ci/MISC-001-google-verification
origin/dependabot/npm_and_yarn/development-tools-b2e65c2e1e
origin/main
```

*(Dependabot branch retained for future updates; Google verification branch kept intentionally for audit trail.)*

## 🔄 Next Observability Actions (Optional)

1. **Activate Google Search Console** – Add property `shopmatch-pro.vercel.app`, choose HTML verification (already live).
2. **Monitor Smoke Test Runs** – Review the “Production Smoke Tests” job under GitHub Actions after each push.
3. **Watch Dependabot** – Reopen automation once new dependency updates arrive under proper branch naming.

Repository is fully synchronized and production monitoring is operational. Continue building with confidence.
