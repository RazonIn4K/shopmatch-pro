# Demo Issues Report & Fixes

**Date:** October 22, 2025  
**Site:** https://shopmatch-pro.vercel.app/  
**Status:** üî¥ Critical Issues Found

## Executive Summary

Comprehensive E2E testing revealed **3 critical issues** preventing the demo from working as advertised on the homepage:

1. ‚ùå **Demo login credentials are invalid** - Users cannot log in with advertised credentials
2. ‚ùå **Jobs page displays error message** - API returns 500 error
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è **No demo data exists** - No jobs or applications to demonstrate features

---

## Issue #1: Invalid Demo Credentials ‚ùå

### Problem
The homepage advertises these credentials:
- **Employer Account:** `owner@test.com` / `testtest123`
- **Job Seeker Account:** `seeker@test.com` / `testtest123`

However, these accounts **do not exist** in Firebase Authentication. Users attempting to log in see:
```
Firebase: Error (auth/invalid-credential)
```

### Evidence
```bash
# Test Result
BROWSER CONSOLE: Signin error: FirebaseError: Firebase: Error (auth/invalid-credential).
=== CURRENT URL === https://shopmatch-pro.vercel.app/login
```

### Root Cause
The existing `scripts/create-user.js` creates different credentials:
- Email: `owner@shopmatchpro.com` (not `owner@test.com`)
- Password: `OwnerPass123!` (not `testtest123`)

There's a mismatch between homepage documentation and actual user creation.

### Fix Implemented ‚úÖ
Created new script: `scripts/create-demo-users.js`

This script creates/updates users with the exact credentials shown on the homepage.

#### Usage:
```bash
# Create demo users with homepage credentials
npm run create-demo-users

# This creates:
# - owner@test.com / testtest123 (role: owner, subActive: true)
# - seeker@test.com / testtest123 (role: seeker, subActive: true)
```

#### Manual Steps Required:
1. Ensure Firebase Admin credentials are configured in Vercel environment variables:
   - `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`
   - `FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL`
   - `FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY`

2. Run the script locally or via a deployment script:
   ```bash
   npm run create-demo-users
   ```

3. Verify users exist in Firebase Console ‚Üí Authentication

## Issue #2: Jobs API Returns 500 Error ‚ùå

### Problem
The `/api/jobs` endpoint fails with HTTP 500 error, causing the jobs page to display:
```
Error loading jobs
Failed to fetch jobs
```

### Evidence
```bash
# Browser Console
BROWSER CONSOLE: Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 500 ()

# Page State
=== PAGE CONTENT ===
Error loading jobsFailed to fetch jobsRetry
```

### Root Cause
Firebase Admin SDK is not properly initialized on Vercel. This can happen when:

1. **Missing Environment Variables:** 
   - `FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY` not set
   - `FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL` not set
   - Private key not properly formatted

2. **Firestore Security Rules:** 
   - May be blocking server-side reads
   - Admin SDK needs proper permissions

3. **No Data:** 
   - Even if API works, there are no jobs in Firestore

### Fix Required ‚ö†Ô∏è

#### Option A: Configure Firebase Admin on Vercel
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí shopmatch-pro ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables

2. Add these variables (from Firebase Console):
   ```
   FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=shopmatch-pro
   FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=firebase-adminsdk-xxxxx@shopmatch-pro.iam.gserviceaccount.com
   FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
   ```

3. **Important:** The private key must:
   - Include the full key with `BEGIN` and `END` markers
   - Use `\n` for newlines (the code handles conversion)
   - Be wrapped in quotes

4. Redeploy the application

#### Option B: Add Public Demo Mode (Recommended)
Modify `src/app/api/jobs/route.ts` to allow unauthenticated public reads for published jobs:

```typescript
export async function GET(request: Request) {
  try {
    const filters = parseFilters(request)

    // Only require auth if filtering by ownerId
    if (filters.ownerId) {
      const auth = await verifyAuth(request)
      if (auth.uid !== filters.ownerId) {
        throw new ApiError('Unauthorized', 403)
      }
    }
    
    // Public can view published jobs without auth
    // Rest of the code remains the same...
  } catch (error) {
    return handleApiError(error)
  }
}
```

Currently, the API seems to work for public jobs, so the 500 error is likely from missing Firebase Admin credentials.

## Issue #3: No Demo Data ‚ö†Ô∏è

### Problem
Even if logging in and the API work, there are **no jobs** in the database to demonstrate the platform's features.

### Impact
- Browse Jobs page shows: "No jobs available"
- Dashboard has no data to display
- Cannot test application flow
- Cannot demonstrate search/filter features
- Portfolio visitors see empty state

### Fix Required
Create seed data script: `scripts/seed-demo-data.js`

#### Demo Data Needed:
1. **5-10 Sample Jobs**
   - Mix of job types (full-time, part-time, contract)
   - Various locations and remote options
   - Different experience levels
   - All owned by `owner@test.com`
   - Status: `published`

2. **Sample Applications**
   - Created by `seeker@test.com`
   - Applied to 2-3 jobs
   - Various statuses (pending, reviewing, accepted, rejected)

#### Implementation Example:
```javascript
// scripts/seed-demo-data.js
const sampleJobs = [
  {
    title: 'Senior React Developer',
    company: 'Tech Corp',
    type: 'full-time',
    location: 'San Francisco, CA',
    remote: true,
    salary: '$120,000 - $180,000',
    experience: 'senior',
    description: 'Join our team building next-gen web applications...',
    requirements: ['5+ years React', 'TypeScript', 'Node.js'],
    status: 'published',
    ownerId: '<owner-uid>',
    // ... other fields
  },
  // ... more jobs
]
```
