### 2. Metadata Updates

**File**: [src/app/layout.tsx](../src/app/layout.tsx)

**Changes**:
- ‚úÖ **Title**: "ShopMatch Pro - Portfolio Demo Project"
- ‚úÖ **Description**: Explicitly states "Portfolio demonstration... This is a test/demo project - no real transactions occur."
- ‚úÖ **Keywords**: Added "portfolio", "demo", "web development"
- ‚úÖ **Author/Creator**: Changed to "David Ortiz" (developer name)
- ‚úÖ **Publisher**: Set to developer name vs. business name

**Search Engine Blocking**:
```typescript
robots: {
  index: false,           // Don't index in search results
  follow: false,          // Don't follow links
  noarchive: true,        // Don't cache pages
  nosnippet: true,        // Don't show snippets
  noimageindex: true,     // Don't index images
  googleBot: {
    index: false,
    follow: false,
  },
}
```

**Custom Meta Tags**:
```typescript
other: {
  'demo-project': 'true',
  'test-mode': 'true',
}
```

---

### 3. Robots.txt Configuration

**File**: [public/robots.txt](../public/robots.txt) (NEW)

**Content**:
```
# ShopMatch Pro - Portfolio Demo Project

Disallow: /

# Block all major crawlers
User-agent: Googlebot
Disallow: /

User-agent: Bingbot
Disallow: /

   - Yellow warning banner is universally recognized
   - "No real transactions" language is important

2. **Metadata Matters**
   - Search engines and hosting providers read metadata
   - Mismatched metadata triggers flags
   - Use `noindex` for demo sites

3. **robots.txt Is Essential**
   - Prevents indexing by search engines
   - First line of defense against spam classification
   - Should include explanatory comments

4. **Portfolio vs. Business Tone**
   - Emphasis on technical achievements vs. business operations
   - Showcase skills and tech stack
