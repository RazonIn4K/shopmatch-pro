## üéØ Next Steps: Production Verification

### Step 1: Get Your Production URL

Your Vercel deployment should have automatically redeployed after:
1. Environment variables were added
2. PR #34 was merged to main

**Find your production URL**:
```bash
# Option 1: Check Vercel dashboard
# Go to: https://vercel.com/razs-projects-29d4f2e6/shopmatch-pro

# Option 2: Check via GitHub deployment
gh api repos/RazonIn4K/shopmatch-pro/deployments | \
  jq -r '.[0].payload.web_url // "Check Vercel dashboard"'
```

Your production URL will be in the format:
- `https://shopmatch-pro.vercel.app` (production domain)
- Or a custom domain if you configured one

### Step 2: Run Health Check (Phase 1)

Once you have your production URL, test the deployment:

```bash
# Replace with your actual production URL
PROD_URL="https://shopmatch-pro.vercel.app"

# Test health endpoint
curl -sS "$PROD_URL/api/health" | jq .
```

**Expected Response**:
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "checks": {
    "firebase": true,
    "stripe": true,
    "environment": true
  }
}
```

**If any check is `false`**, see troubleshooting in `docs/PRODUCTION_VERIFICATION.md`.

### Step 3: Follow 4-Phase Verification Workflow

Reference: [docs/PRODUCTION_VERIFICATION.md](./docs/PRODUCTION_VERIFICATION.md)

#### Phase 1: Initial Deployment & Health Check ‚úÖ
- [x] Vercel deployment completed
- [x] Environment variables configured
- [ ] Health check endpoint verified (do this in Step 2 above)

#### Phase 2: Authentication & User Creation
Follow the checklist in `docs/PRODUCTION_VERIFICATION.md`:
- [ ] Create Seeker Account in production
- [ ] Verify Firebase Auth user created
- [ ] Verify Firestore user document created with `role: "seeker"`
- [ ] Create Owner Account in production
- [ ] Verify Firebase Auth user created
- [ ] Verify Firestore user document created with `role: "owner"`

#### Phase 3: Stripe Subscription Flow ‚≠ê (Replaces ngrok)
This is the critical phase that replaces your local ngrok workflow.

**3.1: Configure Production Webhook**
Follow [docs/STRIPE_WEBHOOK_PRODUCTION_SETUP.md](./docs/STRIPE_WEBHOOK_PRODUCTION_SETUP.md):

```bash
# 1. Add production webhook endpoint in Stripe Dashboard
#    URL: https://your-app-name.vercel.app/api/stripe/webhook
#    Events: checkout.session.completed, customer.subscription.updated, customer.subscription.deleted

# 2. Get webhook signing secret from Stripe Dashboard
#    Copy the secret (starts with whsec_...)

# 3. Update STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET in Vercel
#    Replace the temporary value with production webhook secret

# 4. Vercel will auto-redeploy when you update the env var
```

**3.2: Test Subscription Flow**
- [ ] Log in as owner account
- [ ] Click "Subscribe" or "Upgrade to Pro"
- [ ] Complete Stripe Checkout with test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
- [ ] Verify redirect back to your app after payment
- [ ] Check Stripe Dashboard ‚Üí Events for `checkout.session.completed`
- [ ] Check Vercel Logs for webhook processing
- [ ] Verify `subActive: true` custom claim in Firebase (check user token)
- [ ] Confirm UI shows pro features unlocked

**3.3: Verify Webhook Processing**
```bash
# Check Vercel logs for webhook processing
vercel logs --production | grep "webhook"

# Or check via Vercel dashboard:
# Project ‚Üí Deployments ‚Üí Production ‚Üí Functions ‚Üí Logs
```

#### Phase 4: Core Application Logic
- [ ] **Job Creation** (as owner with active subscription)
  - Create new job posting
  - Verify job appears in owner dashboard
  - Verify job visible to seekers

- [ ] **Job Application** (as seeker)
  - Browse available jobs
  - Submit application with cover letter
  - Verify application appears in seeker dashboard

- [ ] **Application Review** (as owner)
  - View received applications
  - Update application status (reviewed/accepted/rejected)
  - Verify status change appears in seeker dashboard

- [ ] **End-to-End Verification**
  - Verify real-time updates work
  - Check Firestore security rules enforced
  - Test error handling (invalid inputs, auth failures)

## üîß Troubleshooting Resources

### Health Check Failures

**Issue**: `firebase: false`
**Fix**: Check `FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY` formatting in Vercel (must have `\n` escapes)

**Issue**: `stripe: false`
**Fix**: Verify `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` starts with `sk_test_` (test mode) or `sk_live_` (live mode)

**Issue**: `environment: false`
**Fix**: Ensure all 13 variables are set in Vercel (check for typos)

### Webhook Processing Issues

**Issue**: Webhook events not reaching Vercel
**Fix**: Verify webhook URL in Stripe Dashboard matches your production domain

**Issue**: Webhook signature verification failing
**Fix**: Ensure `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in Vercel matches the secret from Stripe Dashboard

**Issue**: `subActive` claim not set after payment
**Fix**: Check Vercel logs for errors in `/api/stripe/webhook` processing

### Complete Troubleshooting Guide

See [docs/PRODUCTION_VERIFICATION.md](./docs/PRODUCTION_VERIFICATION.md) for detailed troubleshooting steps.

## ‚úÖ Ready to Proceed

You are now ready to:

1. **Get your production URL** from Vercel dashboard
2. **Run the health check** (`curl https://your-url.vercel.app/api/health`)
3. **Follow the 4-phase verification** in `docs/PRODUCTION_VERIFICATION.md`
4. **Configure Stripe webhooks** using `docs/STRIPE_WEBHOOK_PRODUCTION_SETUP.md`

Once Phase 3 (Stripe subscription flow) is verified, your production deployment will be complete and you'll have replaced the ngrok workflow with a permanent production webhook setup.
