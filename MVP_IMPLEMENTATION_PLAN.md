## Phase 2 Completion Summary

**Status**: ✅ **PRODUCTION READY** (Completed: 2025-10-12)

### What Was Delivered

Phase 2 implemented the complete end-to-end applications workflow, enabling job owners to manage postings and review applications while job seekers can browse jobs and submit applications.

**Components Implemented** (7 total):
- ✅ `ApplicationDetailDialog` - 390+ lines, dual-mode (owner/seeker), full CRUD operations
- ✅ `ApplicationCard` - Display component for application lists
- ✅ `JobCard` - Job listing display with actions
- ✅ `JobForm` - Job creation/editing form with validation
- ✅ `Dialog` (Radix UI) - Accessible modal system
- ✅ `Textarea` (Radix UI) - Form textarea component
- ✅ Role-based dashboard routing

**API Routes Implemented** (10 endpoints):
- ✅ `GET /api/jobs` - List jobs with filters (public)
- ✅ `POST /api/jobs` - Create new job (owner only)
- ✅ `GET /api/jobs/[id]` - Get single job details
- ✅ `PUT /api/jobs/[id]` - Update job (owner only)
- ✅ `DELETE /api/jobs/[id]` - Delete job (owner only)
- ✅ `POST /api/jobs/[id]/apply` - Submit application (seeker only)
- ✅ `GET /api/applications` - List applications (role-based)
- ✅ `PATCH /api/applications/[id]` - Update application status (owner only)

- ✅ `GET /api/applications/export` - Download applications as CSV (owner only)

**Dashboards Implemented** (3 pages):
- ✅ `/dashboard` - Role-based router (redirects to owner/seeker)
- ✅ `/dashboard/owner` - Job management and application review
- ✅ `/dashboard/seeker` - Application tracking and job discovery

**Critical Hotfixes Applied**:

## Firestore Composite Indexes

**Status**: ✅ All 4 indexes operational and built

Firestore composite indexes are required for queries that combine `where()` filters with `orderBy()` clauses. These indexes were created during Phase 2 and are fully operational.

### Index 1: Owner Applications (Status Filter)
```
Collection: applications
Fields: ownerId (Ascending), status (Ascending), createdAt (Descending), __name__ (Descending)
Query: applications.where('ownerId', '==', userId).where('status', '==', status).orderBy('createdAt', 'desc')
Status: ✅ Enabled
Use Case: Owner filtering applications by status (pending, reviewed, accepted, rejected)
```

### Index 2: Owner Applications (All)
```
Collection: applications
Fields: ownerId (Ascending), createdAt (Descending), __name__ (Descending)
Query: applications.where('ownerId', '==', userId).orderBy('createdAt', 'desc')
Status: ✅ Enabled
Use Case: Owner viewing all applications received across all jobs
```

### Index 3: Job Applications
```
Collection: applications
Fields: jobId (Ascending), createdAt (Descending), __name__ (Descending)
Query: applications.where('jobId', '==', jobId).orderBy('createdAt', 'desc')
Status: ✅ Enabled
Use Case: Owner viewing all applications for a specific job
```

### Index 4: Seeker Applications
```
Collection: applications
Fields: seekerId (Ascending), createdAt (Descending), __name__ (Descending)
Query: applications.where('seekerId', '==', userId).orderBy('createdAt', 'desc')
Status: ✅ Enabled
Use Case: Seeker viewing all their submitted applications
Created: 2025-10-12 (Phase 2 completion)
Resolution: This was the missing index that blocked seeker dashboard
```

### Understanding the __name__ Field

The `__name__` field is Firestore's internal document ID field. It is automatically appended to all ordered queries to ensure consistent ordering when multiple documents have identical values for the specified sort field (e.g., same `createdAt` timestamp).

**Why __name__ is included**:
- Firestore requires a unique sort key for stable pagination
- Without __name__, documents with identical timestamps could appear in different orders across queries
- The __name__ field is added automatically by Firestore - you don't specify it in your query code

**Example Query in Code**:
```typescript
// Your code (no __name__ specified)
const query = db.collection('applications')
  .where('seekerId', '==', userId)
  .orderBy('createdAt', 'desc')

// Firestore internally appends __name__ for stability
// Index required: (seekerId ↑, createdAt ↓, __name__ ↓)
```

### Creating Indexes

**Automatic Creation** (Recommended):
1. Run a query that requires an index
2. Firestore throws `FAILED_PRECONDITION` error with auto-create link
3. Click the link to auto-create the index in Firebase Console
4. Wait 2-5 minutes for index to build

**Manual Creation**:
1. Go to Firebase Console → Firestore → Indexes
2. Click "Create Index"
3. Specify collection, fields, and sort directions
4. Save and wait for build completion

### Index Build Status Monitoring

Run the test script to verify all indexes:
```bash
node scripts/verify-end-to-end.js
```

This will test all 4 query patterns and confirm indexes are operational.

## Executive Summary

### What We're Building Today

**Core Features**:
1. **Job Posting System** - Owners can create, edit, delete, and view their job postings
2. **Job Discovery** - Public browsing of all published jobs with filtering
3. **Application System** - Seekers can apply to jobs, owners can review applications
4. **Dashboards** - Role-based dashboards for owners and seekers

### Parallel Workstreams

These can be worked on simultaneously:

**Workstream A: Backend & API** (3-4 hours)
- Firestore data models and security rules
- API route implementations
- Server-side validation

**Workstream B: UI Components & Pages** (4-5 hours)
- Job posting forms
- Job listing views
- Application forms
- Dashboard layouts

**Workstream C: Integration & Testing** (1-2 hours)
- Connect frontend to API
- End-to-end flow testing
- Bug fixes and polish

## Complete Data Models

### 1. Jobs Collection

```typescript
// Collection: jobs
// Document ID: Auto-generated by Firestore

interface Job {
  // Identity
  id: string;                    // Derived from Firestore document ID (map from doc.id)
  ownerId: string;               // Firebase UID of job poster (indexed)

  // Core Details
  title: string;                 // Job title (required, 5-100 chars)
  company: string;               // Company name (required, 2-100 chars)
  description: string;           // Full job description (required, 50-5000 chars, supports markdown)

  remote: boolean;               // true if remote work allowed

  // Compensation
  salary?: {
    min: number;                 // Minimum salary

    period: 'hourly' | 'monthly' | 'yearly';
  };

  // Requirements
  requirements?: string[];       // Array of requirement strings
  skills?: string[];             // Required skills/technologies
  experience?: 'entry' | 'mid' | 'senior' | 'lead';

  // Status & Metadata
  status: 'draft' | 'published' | 'closed';
