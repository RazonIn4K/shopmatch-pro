# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

**üìå IMPORTANT**: For detailed implementation plan, data models, API specs, and design specifications, see **[MVP_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md](./MVP_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md)**.

## Development Commands

### Essential Commands
- `npm run dev` ‚Äî Start development server with Turbopack on http://localhost:3000
- `npm run build` ‚Äî Create optimized production build (always run before deployment)
- `npm run start` ‚Äî Serve the production build locally for verification
- `npm run lint` ‚Äî Run ESLint with Next.js TypeScript rules (must pass before commits)

### Utility Scripts
- `npm run validate-env` ‚Äî Verify all required Firebase and Stripe environment variables are configured correctly (run after any .env.local changes)
- `npm run create-user` ‚Äî Create test users in Firebase with proper Firestore documents and roles (useful for development and testing)

## Documentation Stack & Workflow Gates

- Use `docs/README.md` as the canonical index; it links to architecture, security, testing, deployment, analytics, observability, and Firestore rule specs.
- Governance decisions live in `docs/adr/`, operational playbooks in `docs/runbooks/`, and team cadence material in `docs/WORKFLOW_ORDER.md`, `docs/PROMPT_PACK.md`, and `docs/PLAYBOOK_SHOPMATCH.md`.
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/*` and `.github/pull_request_template.md` drive the mock team workflow‚Äîalways link evidence (tests, logs, screenshots) in PRs.
- Continue to reference the external status docs under `/CAREER/Portfolio-Projects/ShopMatchPro/` for execution journal, component registry, decision matrix, landscape alignment, and roadmap context.

### Persona Prompt Primer

- When invoking any AI persona, prefix the request with:\
  `Use my Technology Landscape 2025 and S2 maturity. If you make tech choices, justify them using my Decision Matrix weights (Business Fit 25, Maturity 20, Cost 15, Capability 15, Ecosystem 10, Security 10, Performance 5).`
- Persona-specific prompts live in `docs/PROMPT_PACK.md`‚Äîuse them for PM, Tech Lead, QA, Security, Pair Programming, and Researcher flows.
- Enforce the ordered workflow from `docs/WORKFLOW_ORDER.md` (Aim ‚Üí Plan ‚Üí Build/SHOOT ‚Üí Wrench ‚Üí Gate ‚Üí SKIN) and document outcomes in the Execution Journal.

## Architecture Overview

ShopMatch Pro is a Next.js 15 subscription-based job board built with the App Router pattern. The application uses Firebase for authentication and database, Stripe for subscription management, and implements a role-based access control system.

### Core Technology Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with Turbopack, React 19, TypeScript (strict mode)
- **Authentication**: Firebase Auth with email/password and Google OAuth
- **Database**: Cloud Firestore for user data and application state
- **Payments**: Stripe Checkout and Subscriptions with webhook-based synchronization
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4 with class-variance-authority for component variants
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation via @hookform/resolvers

### Project Structure Philosophy
The codebase follows Next.js App Router conventions with these key organizational principles:

- **Route Organization**: `src/app/` contains all routes. Auth pages live in `(auth)` group to share layouts without affecting URLs. API routes follow RESTful patterns under `src/app/api/`.

- **Module Boundaries**: `src/lib/` houses shared integrations and utilities organized by service (firebase/, stripe/). `src/components/` contains reusable UI primitives built with Radix UI and Tailwind.

- **Configuration Centralization**: All Firebase and Stripe configuration lives in dedicated config files (`src/lib/firebase/`, `src/lib/stripe/config.ts`) with comprehensive documentation explaining security rationale and usage patterns.

## Development Roadmap (Fast-Track MVP)

Follow the five-phase sequence defined in `MVP_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`:
1. **Backend Foundation (Phase 1)** ‚Äî Implement Firestore models, security rules, and RESTful job/application API routes with subscription and role guards.
2. **UI Components (Phase 2)** ‚Äî Build reusable job/application forms, cards, filters, and dashboard widgets using shadcn/ui and Tailwind v4.
3. **Pages & Routes (Phase 3)** ‚Äî Wire public listings, job CRUD screens, and role-based dashboards; route protect with AuthContext.
4. **Testing & Polish (Phase 4)** ‚Äî Execute the testing checklist (lint, flow validations, UX polish, performance passes).
5. **Deployment Prep (Phase 5)** ‚Äî Run production build, finalize Firestore indexes/rules, document environment updates, and smoke-test `npm start`.

## Missing Features & Implementation Approach

### 1. Job Posting System

**Firestore Data Model**:
```typescript
// Collection: jobs
{
  id: string,
  ownerId: string,           // Firebase UID of job poster
  title: string,
  description: string,
  company: string,
  location: string,
  type: 'full-time' | 'part-time' | 'contract' | 'freelance',
  salary?: { min: number, max: number, currency: string },
  status: 'draft' | 'published' | 'closed',
  createdAt: Timestamp,
  updatedAt: Timestamp,
  expiresAt?: Timestamp
}
```

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Create API routes: `/api/jobs` (GET, POST), `/api/jobs/[id]` (GET, PUT, DELETE)
2. Add authorization middleware to verify `subActive` custom claim for job posting
3. Build UI pages: `/jobs/new`, `/jobs/[id]/edit`, `/jobs` (listing)
4. Implement form validation with Zod schema for job fields
5. Add Firestore security rules for job documents (owners can CRUD own jobs)

**Key Pattern**: Check `subActive` custom claim before allowing job creation:
```typescript
const decodedToken = await adminAuth.verifyIdToken(token)
if (!decodedToken.subActive) {
  return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Active subscription required' }, { status: 403 })
}
```

### 2. Job Application System

**Firestore Data Model**:
```typescript
// Collection: applications
{
  id: string,
  jobId: string,             // Reference to jobs collection
  seekerId: string,          // Firebase UID of applicant
  ownerId: string,           // Job owner UID (denormalized for queries)
  status: 'pending' | 'reviewed' | 'accepted' | 'rejected',
  coverLetter?: string,
  resumeUrl?: string,        // Cloud Storage URL
  createdAt: Timestamp,
  updatedAt: Timestamp
}
```

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Create API routes: `/api/jobs/[id]/apply` (POST), `/api/applications` (GET)
2. Add Cloud Storage integration for resume uploads (optional for MVP)
3. Build application form UI on job detail pages
4. Create application list views for both owners and seekers
5. Implement status update functionality for job owners

**Key Pattern**: Denormalize ownerId for efficient querying:
```typescript
// Owner can query: applications.where('ownerId', '==', userId)
// Seeker can query: applications.where('seekerId', '==', userId)
```

### 3. Dashboard Views

**Owner Dashboard** (`/dashboard/owner`):
- Display jobs posted by user (with application counts)
- Recent applications received
- Quick actions: Create job, View applications

**Seeker Dashboard** (`/dashboard/seeker`):
- Applied jobs with application status
- Saved jobs (optional for MVP)
- Profile completion status

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Create protected dashboard routes with role-based rendering
2. Build dashboard components using existing UI primitives
3. Implement real-time Firestore queries for live updates
4. Add pagination for job/application lists

### 4. Job Browsing & Search

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Create `/jobs` public listing page with server-side rendering
2. Implement Firestore compound queries with filters (type, location)
3. Add client-side search using Firestore text search or Algolia integration
4. Build filter UI components (location, job type, salary range)
5. Implement pagination or infinite scroll

**Performance Consideration**: For production, consider Algolia or Typesense for full-text search. For MVP, basic Firestore queries with limited filters are sufficient.

## Firebase Integration Architecture

### Dual-Context Pattern
The application uses two separate Firebase contexts that must never be mixed:

**Client-Side (`src/lib/firebase/client.ts`)**:
- Initialized with NEXT_PUBLIC_ environment variables (safe for browser exposure)
- Used in React components and client-side code
- Handles user-facing authentication flows and real-time data subscriptions
- Powers the AuthContext provider for application-wide auth state

**Server-Side (`src/lib/firebase/admin.ts`)**:
- Uses Firebase Admin SDK with service account credentials
- Operates with elevated privileges for administrative operations
- Critical for custom claims management (role, subActive) via `adminAuth.setCustomUserClaims()`
- Required for Stripe webhook processing to update user subscription status

### Service Account Credentials Approach
This codebase uses service account credentials (NOT Application Default Credentials) for Firebase Admin SDK:
- Environment variables: `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`, `FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL`, `FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY`
- No Google account login or gcloud CLI required for development
- Works consistently across all deployment environments
- See detailed rationale in `src/lib/firebase/admin.ts` comments

### Authentication Context Architecture
The `AuthContext` (`src/lib/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`) provides global authentication state with these key features:
- Automatic user document creation in Firestore on signup with role assignment (owner/seeker)
- Real-time auth state synchronization via `onAuthStateChanged`
- Merges Firebase Auth user with Firestore user data for extended properties (role, subscription status)
- Provides type-safe `AppUser` interface extending Firebase User with application-specific fields

## Stripe Integration Architecture

### Subscription Lifecycle Flow
The subscription system uses a webhook-driven architecture to maintain synchronization:

1. **Checkout Initiation** (`src/app/api/stripe/checkout/route.ts`):
   - Verifies user authentication via Firebase Admin token verification
   - Creates Stripe Checkout Session with `client_reference_id` set to Firebase UID
   - Redirects to hosted Stripe checkout page

2. **Webhook Processing** (`src/app/api/stripe/webhook/route.ts`):
   - Receives Stripe events (subscription.created/updated/deleted, checkout.session.completed)
   - Verifies webhook signature using raw request body (CRITICAL for security)
   - Updates Firebase custom claims via `adminAuth.setCustomUserClaims()` to control access
   - Synchronizes subscription status to Firestore users collection

3. **Access Control**:
   - Custom claims (`subActive: true/false`) stored on Firebase Auth user token
   - Client-side code checks custom claims after token refresh to enable/disable features
   - Firestore documents maintain duplicate subscription data for querying and reporting

### Critical Stripe Route Requirements
All Stripe API routes MUST use Node.js runtime (NOT Edge Runtime) due to:
- Raw request body access required for webhook signature verification
- Firebase Admin SDK compatibility requirements
- Stripe SDK dependency on Node.js APIs

Add this to any new Stripe route files:
```typescript
export const runtime = 'nodejs' // Required for Stripe webhook signature verification
```

### Webhook Security Architecture
The webhook handler implements multiple security layers:
1. Signature verification using `stripe.webhooks.constructEvent()` with raw body
2. Event type validation against known webhook events
3. User lookup via Firestore query (stripeCustomerId ‚Üí Firebase UID mapping)
4. Atomic custom claims updates to prevent race conditions
5. Error handling that prevents information leakage while logging for debugging

## Environment Variable Architecture

### Required Variables
The application requires strict environment variable configuration validated by `scripts/validate-env.js`:

**Client-Side (NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix - exposed to browser)**:
- Firebase configuration: API_KEY, AUTH_DOMAIN, PROJECT_ID, STORAGE_BUCKET, MESSAGING_SENDER_ID, APP_ID
- APP_URL for OAuth redirects and webhook callback URLs

**Server-Side (never exposed to browser)**:
- Firebase Admin: PROJECT_ID, CLIENT_EMAIL, PRIVATE_KEY (service account credentials)
- Stripe: SECRET_KEY, WEBHOOK_SECRET, PRICE_ID_PRO

### Configuration Validation
Always run `npm run validate-env` after:
- Copying .env.local.template to .env.local
- Modifying any environment variables
- Before deploying to new environments
- When encountering Firebase or Stripe initialization errors

## TypeScript Configuration

The project uses strict TypeScript with these key settings:
- `strict: true` ‚Äî All strict type checking enabled
- `target: "ES2017"` ‚Äî Modern JavaScript features with broad compatibility
- Path alias `@/*` maps to `src/*` for clean imports
- `noEmit: true` ‚Äî TypeScript only for type checking, Next.js handles compilation

When adding new files, always use absolute imports: `import { X } from '@/lib/...'` instead of relative paths.

## Tailwind CSS v4 Configuration

The project uses Tailwind CSS v4 with the new oxide engine:
- Configuration via `@tailwind` directives in global CSS (no tailwind.config.js)
- PostCSS integration via `@tailwindcss/postcss` plugin
- Theme customization through CSS custom properties
- Component composition using `class-variance-authority` for type-safe variant APIs

## Key Development Patterns

### Form Validation Pattern
Forms use React Hook Form + Zod with server-side type safety:
```typescript
import { zodResolver } from '@hookform/resolvers/zod'
import { z } from 'zod'

const schema = z.object({ /* fields */ })
type FormData = z.infer<typeof schema>

const form = useForm<FormData>({ resolver: zodResolver(schema) })
```

### API Route Authentication Pattern
Server-side routes verify Firebase tokens before processing:
```typescript
const authHeader = request.headers.get('authorization')
const token = authHeader?.substring(7) // Remove 'Bearer '
const decodedToken = await adminAuth.verifyIdToken(token)
const userId = decodedToken.uid
```

### Custom Claims Pattern
Subscription status is controlled via Firebase custom claims (NOT just Firestore):
- Firestore documents store subscription data for queries and UI display
- Custom claims control access (checked on every authenticated request)
- Claims are updated by Stripe webhooks via `adminAuth.setCustomUserClaims()`
- Client code must refresh tokens after subscription changes to get updated claims

## Testing Stripe Webhooks Locally

When developing Stripe integration features:

1. **Use ngrok for webhook forwarding**:
   ```bash
   ngrok http 3000
   ```

2. **Configure Stripe webhook endpoint**:
   - Go to Stripe Dashboard ‚Üí Webhooks
   - Create endpoint with ngrok URL: `https://xxx.ngrok-free.app/api/stripe/webhook`
   - Copy webhook signing secret to `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in .env.local

3. **Test webhook events**:
   - Use Stripe Dashboard ‚Üí Webhooks ‚Üí Send test webhook
   - Or use Stripe CLI: `stripe trigger checkout.session.completed`
   - Check server logs for webhook processing confirmation

## Common Development Tasks

### Adding a New Subscription Tier
1. Create new Price in Stripe Dashboard
2. Add price ID to `STRIPE_CONFIG` in `src/lib/stripe/config.ts`
3. Add tier definition to `SUBSCRIPTION_TIERS`
4. Update checkout route to support new tier parameter
5. Update webhook handler if tier-specific logic needed

### Adding a New Authentication Provider
1. Enable provider in Firebase Console ‚Üí Authentication ‚Üí Sign-in method
2. Add provider configuration to client-side auth flow in `AuthContext.tsx`
3. Handle provider-specific user document creation in `createUserDocument()`
4. Update UI to show new sign-in button

### Extending User Roles
1. Update `UserRole` type in `src/lib/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`
2. Modify user document creation to support new role
3. Update custom claims structure if role affects access control
4. Add role-specific UI logic and routing rules

## Security Considerations

### Never Commit These Files
- `.env.local` ‚Äî Contains all secrets and API keys
- `serviceAccountKey.json` ‚Äî Firebase service account credentials (if you generate one)
- Any files with `PRIVATE_KEY` or `SECRET` in contents

### Firestore Security Rules
When modifying Firestore documents, ensure security rules allow the operation:
- User documents: Users can read/write their own documents
- Admin operations: Server-side Admin SDK bypasses security rules
- Query operations: Ensure indexes exist for compound queries

### API Route Security Checklist
Before deploying new API routes:
- [ ] Verify user authentication for protected endpoints
- [ ] Validate and sanitize all input parameters
- [ ] Use Firebase Admin SDK for elevated privilege operations
- [ ] Return appropriate HTTP status codes
- [ ] Log errors server-side but don't expose to client
- [ ] Rate limit sensitive endpoints if needed

## Deployment Configuration

When deploying to production:

1. **Environment Variables**: Set all required env vars in hosting platform (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)
2. **Stripe Webhooks**: Update webhook endpoint URL to production domain
3. **Firebase Security Rules**: Review and tighten Firestore/Storage rules for production
4. **CORS Configuration**: Update Stripe allowed origins if using custom domains
5. **Build Verification**: Run `npm run build` locally to catch build-time errors early

2. **Component Tests** (React components, forms, UI logic)
3. **E2E Tests** (user flows, happy path + edge cases)
4. **Firestore Rules Emulator Tests** (security rules validation)

For each test type:
- Test cases (arrange, act, assert format)
- Pass/fail criteria
- Mock requirements (Firebase, Stripe, external APIs)

Provide a minimal Playwright spec skeleton for the critical user flow.

Reference commands from `docs/TESTING.md` and security requirements from `docs/FIRESTORE_RULES_SPEC.md`.
```

**When to Use**: After Tech Lead plan approved, before implementation starts, when bugs are found

**Expected Output**: Structured test plan with Playwright skeleton

### Security Engineer - "Threat Model"

**Purpose**: Identify vulnerabilities and attack vectors before code ships

**Prompt**:
```
Perform a security audit for feature X touching these areas:
- API routes: [list routes]
- Firestore collections: [list collections]
- User roles: [owner/seeker/admin]

Return:
1. **3 Abuse Vectors** (what could an attacker do?)
2. **Mitigations** (how we prevent each attack)
3. **Test Plan** (how to verify mitigations work)
4. **Rate Limiting Recommendations** (if applicable)
5. **Zod Schema Validation** (input validation requirements)

Reference threat model from `docs/SECURITY.md` and rules spec from `docs/FIRESTORE_RULES_SPEC.md`.

For each mitigation, specify:
- Where implemented (Firestore rules, API middleware, client validation)
- How tested (emulator test, E2E test, manual verification)
```

**When to Use**: Before implementing auth/payment features, when adding new API routes, during security reviews

**Expected Output**: Threat matrix with mitigations and test plan

---

### Pair Programmer - "Implementation Diffs"

**Purpose**: Generate step-by-step implementation with code snippets

**Prompt**:
```
Generate a step-by-step implementation plan for feature X:

1. **File Structure** (new files, modified files)
2. **Implementation Order** (which file to start with, dependencies)
3. **Code Snippets** (key functions, API routes, React components)
4. **Accessibility Notes** (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, focus management)
5. **Bundle Budget Impact** (estimate added KB, how to optimize)

Follow these constraints:
- Use existing patterns from `src/app/api/`, `src/components/`, `src/lib/`
- Respect TypeScript strict mode
- Use shadcn/ui components where possible
- Add Zod validation for all forms
- Include error boundaries and loading states

Reference style guide from `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` Component Patterns section.
```

**When to Use**: During active development, when stuck on implementation details, for code review preparation

**Expected Output**: Annotated code snippets with accessibility and performance notes

---

### Researcher - "Landscape Drift"

**Purpose**: Monitor technology landscape for changes affecting our Decision Matrix

**Prompt**:
```
Scan for 2025 changes in:
- Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Cloud Functions)
- Stripe (Checkout, Subscriptions, Webhooks)
- Vercel (Next.js hosting, edge functions, serverless)
- Next.js 15+ (App Router, Turbopack, React Server Components)

Identify changes that would:
1. **Increase** our Decision Matrix scores (new features, better pricing, improved DX)
2. **Decrease** our scores (deprecations, price increases, breaking changes)
3. **Require ADR updates** (architectural decisions invalidated by new info)

For each significant change:
- Impact summary (5-10 words)
- Recommended action (adopt, investigate, defer, ignore)
- ADR to update (if applicable)

Reference current scores from `SHOPMATCH_PRO_TECH_DECISION_MATRIX.md`.
```

**When to Use**: Monthly landscape review, before adding new dependencies, when considering migrations

**Expected Output**: Change summary with ADR update recommendations

## Decision Framework Integration

### Technology Landscape 2025 & S-Tier Maturity

ShopMatch Pro is assessed as **S2 (Standardized)** maturity:
- Standard tech stack (Next.js, Firebase, Stripe)
- Industry best practices (security rules, webhooks, role-based auth)
- Production-ready patterns (error handling, testing, observability)

**Decision Matrix Weights** (used for all technology choices):
- **Business Fit**: 25 - Does it solve our problem directly?
- **Maturity**: 20 - Is it production-ready with stable APIs?
- **Cost**: 15 - Total cost of ownership (licenses, hosting, maintenance)
- **Capability**: 15 - Feature completeness vs. requirements
- **Ecosystem**: 10 - Community size, plugins, integrations
- **Security**: 10 - Security track record, compliance, audit tools
- **Performance**: 5 - Speed, scalability, resource efficiency

**How to Use the Decision Matrix**:

1. **When Evaluating New Dependencies**:
   - Score candidate on 0-100 scale for each weight
   - Calculate weighted score: `(BusinessFit √ó 0.25) + (Maturity √ó 0.20) + ... + (Performance √ó 0.05)`
   - Threshold: Adopt if score ‚â• 80, investigate if 60-79, reject if < 60

2. **When Writing ADRs**:
   - Document Decision Matrix scores for finalist options
   - Explain why chosen option scored highest
   - Note trade-offs (what we sacrificed for higher scores in priority weights)

3. **Example** (Stripe vs. PayPal for payments):
   ```
   Stripe: Business Fit 90, Maturity 95, Cost 70, Capability 90, Ecosystem 85, Security 90, Performance 85
   Weighted Score: (90√ó0.25) + (95√ó0.20) + (70√ó0.15) + (90√ó0.15) + (85√ó0.10) + (90√ó0.10) + (85√ó0.05) = 87.25

   PayPal: Business Fit 80, Maturity 90, Cost 75, Capability 70, Ecosystem 80, Security 85, Performance 75
   Weighted Score: 80.25

   Decision: Choose Stripe (higher score, better developer experience, more capabilities)
   ```

## Automation & Tooling Tips

### Saved Prompts (Recommended Setup)

**Raycast (macOS)**:
1. Create Raycast Quicklink for each persona prompt
2. Assign keyboard shortcuts: `‚åò‚å•P` (PM), `‚åò‚å•T` (TL), `‚åò‚å•Q` (QA), etc.
3. Include auto-populated context (current file path, git branch)

**Shortcuts (iOS/macOS)**:
1. Create shortcut to read prompt from Notes app
2. Auto-append current task from Reminders
3. Send to ChatGPT/Claude API with one tap

**Stream Deck (Hardware)**:
1. Assign button per persona
2. Button press copies prompt to clipboard + opens AI tool
3. Color-code by role (blue=TL, red=Security, green=QA)

**VS Code / Cursor**:
1. Save prompts as code snippets (prefix: `pm-`, `tl-`, `qa-`)
2. Use Cursor Rules (`.cursorrules`) to inject context automatically
3. Configure Copilot to reference `docs/` in suggestions

### CI/CD Integration Points

**Bundle Budget Check** (add to `.github/workflows/ci.yml`):
```yaml
- name: Check Bundle Size
  run: |
    npm run build
    BUNDLE_SIZE=$(du -sk .next/static | cut -f1)
    MAX_SIZE=307200  # 300 KB in KB
    if [ $BUNDLE_SIZE -gt $MAX_SIZE ]; then
      echo "‚ùå Bundle size $BUNDLE_SIZE KB exceeds limit $MAX_SIZE KB"
      exit 1
    fi
    echo "‚úÖ Bundle size $BUNDLE_SIZE KB within limit"
```

**Accessibility Check** (add axe-core E2E test):
```typescript
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test'
import AxeBuilder from '@axe-core/playwright'

test('homepage accessibility', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('http://localhost:3000')
  const results = await new AxeBuilder({ page }).analyze()
  expect(results.violations).toEqual([])
})
```

**Firestore Rules Validation**:
```bash
# Add to CI pipeline
firebase emulators:exec --only firestore \
  "node scripts/test-firestore-rules.js"
```

### Recommended AI Tool Combinations

**For Solo Development**:
- **Claude (via API or web)** - Best for architecture analysis, security reviews, long-context tasks
- **GPT-5 Thinking** - Best for complex problem-solving, multi-step planning
- **Cursor / Copilot** - Best for code generation during active development
- **Perplexity** - Best for researching latest package versions, API changes

**Workflow Example** (feature implementation):
1. Morning: **GPT-5 Thinking** for PM "why this way?" analysis
2. Pre-coding: **Claude** for Tech Lead architectural plan
3. Coding: **Cursor** for Pair Programmer implementation
4. Testing: **Claude** for QA test plan generation
5. Security review: **Claude** for Security Engineer threat model
6. Research: **Perplexity** for dependency updates

### Evidence Automation

**Playwright Test Reports**:
```bash
# Generate HTML report with screenshots
npm run test:e2e -- --reporter=html
# Attach report to PR automatically via GitHub Actions
```

**Lighthouse CI** (add to CI pipeline):
```yaml
- name: Run Lighthouse CI
  uses: treosh/lighthouse-ci-action@v9
  with:
    urls: |
      http://localhost:3000
      http://localhost:3000/dashboard
    uploadArtifacts: true
```

**Firestore Query Profiling**:
```typescript
// Add to API routes during development
const startTime = Date.now()
const snapshot = await query.get()
console.log(`Query took ${Date.now() - startTime}ms, returned ${snapshot.size} docs`)
```
