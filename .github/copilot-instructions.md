## Your Coding Guidelines

### Branch & Commit Standards
- All branches MUST follow: `type/<ID>-<slug>`
-   - type ∈ {feat|fix|perf|sec|docs|test|refactor|ci|build}
    -   - <ID> = UPPERCASE work item (UI-001, ARCH-001, SEC-001)
        -   - <slug> = short-kebab summary
            - - Commits: Conventional Commits format: `feat(scope): description (ID)`
              - - PR titles: `[ID] Description (L6/L5)` format
               
                - ### Code Review Standards
               
                - #### Type Safety (Strict TS)
                - - Always use strict TypeScript (`strict: true` in tsconfig)
                  - - Properly type all function parameters and returns
                    - - Use correct `await` context for `context.params` in Next.js 15 App Router
                      - - Validate context types in API routes and Server Components
                       
                        - #### Validation & Security
                        - - Input validation: All APIs MUST use **zod** for runtime validation
                          - - Never trust user input without validation
                            - - Sanitize any dynamic data in queries/mutations
                              - - Rate-limiting: All public endpoints must have rate-limiting middleware
                                - - Authentication: Verify `auth()` claims and user roles in protected routes
                                 
                                  - #### Performance Optimization
                                  - - First-load JS MUST be ≤ 300 KB (critical gate)
                                    - - Use `next/dynamic` for code-splitting large components
                                      - - Lazy-load non-critical features (charts, modals, heavy libraries)
                                        - - Check import sizes—prefer lightweight alternatives
                                          - - Server Components by default; Client Components only when needed
                                           
                                            - #### Accessibility (A11y)
                                            - - Zero axe violations on public routes (/, /dashboard, /subscribe)
                                              - - ARIA labels on interactive elements
                                                - - Semantic HTML (use <button> not <div> for buttons)
                                                  - - Color contrast ratio ≥ 4.5:1 for text
                                                    - - Keyboard navigation support throughout
                                                     
                                                      - #### Firestore & Database
                                                      - - Firestore rules MUST match feature scope (no overly permissive rules)
                                                        - - Index creation for queries with multiple filters
                                                          - - Use composite keys where needed
                                                            - - Validate row-level security in backend logic
                                                             
                                                              - #### Stripe Integration
                                                              - - All Stripe handlers MUST `export const runtime = 'nodejs'`
                                                                - - Verify webhook signatures against raw body + secret
                                                                  - - Never log sensitive Stripe data (card tokens, PII)
                                                                    - - Use Stripe test keys in dev; never commit prod keys
                                                                      - - Implement idempotency keys for payment operations
                                                                       
                                                                        - #### Testing

                                                                            - - Tests must pass before merge
                                                                              - - Document test commands in PR
                                                                               
                                                                                - #### Observability & Logging

                                                                                    - - Never log PII or sensitive credentials
